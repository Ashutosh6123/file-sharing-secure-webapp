   Magic email sent: ✅

🔍 Testing client login view...
   Response status: 302 ✅
   Redirect to: /dashboard-client/ ✅
   Magic email sent: ✅

🔍 Testing general login view...
   Response status: 302 ✅
   Redirect to: /dashboard-ops/ ✅
   Magic email sent: ✅
```

### Token Creation Verification
```
📊 Token count after login attempts:
   - Initial: 8
   - Final: 11
   - New tokens created: 3 ✅
```

**Result:** ✅ **All 3 login attempts generated magic login emails**

## 🎉 Final Confirmation

### ✅ **REQUIREMENT SATISFIED:**
> "Magic login email link is sent to email for both the ops and client on each login attempt"
